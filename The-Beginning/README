In this section, I will create small projects that will help me understand the logistics and possibilities of Simulink.
The first project I will start with is to model the velocity of an object falling with the effects of air resistance(drag). 

Using the equation: Fd = av^2 
I will first try to model the Drag proportion of the system. 

First, we will need a source block of type Sine Wave. This will represent the velocity in the system. And since drag is proportional to velocity squared. So, we need to add a math function of squared operation to the output of the velocity block. Refer to (Figure 1) in Sys-Images. This will allow us to obtain velocity squared.
Next, we need to add the coefficient "a" to obtain Drag in our system. We do this by add ing a Gain block to the output of the math function block. refer to (Figure 2.)
