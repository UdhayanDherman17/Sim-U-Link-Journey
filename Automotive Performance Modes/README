In this project, I will try to simulate the logic for an automotive performance package. Vehicles today have dozens of computers that together adjust the car's behavior in response to data read by hundreds of sensors. In this simplified system, let's assume that they are responding to two sensors —speed and lateral acceleration—to decide between a "high performance" and "economy" mode.

To generate simulated data we will use a Signal editor. We will simulate 2 signals: speed velocity, and acceleration.
in terms of direction, the velocity will always be positive as the car doesn't need performance modes in reverse. As for accelerations, we need the absolute value as decelerating will induce a different mode, therefore positive values are needed for condition purposes.

For the conditions: 
When traveling if (>100km/h) OR (>35km/h AND accelerating >3m/s^2)
  enable mode 1 
else 
  enable mode 2 

For the condition statements: I will use "Compare to Constant blocks" So if the velocity signal is >100 or >35. As for the Logic conditions, I will use "Logic Operators". Thus, if the velocity and accel is (>100) OR (>35 AND >3)
Then using a switch statement will allow us to use the signal to activate performance modes. 

We will simulate performance modes using "Constant Blocks" with constants 1 and 2.
Setting the switch statement to >1 will let the signal flow to constant 2 if the signal carries the true condition and activate mode 2.
Else if not >1 the switch will activate the "else" signal and output mode 1.
