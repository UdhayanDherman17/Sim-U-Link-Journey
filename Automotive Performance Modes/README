In this project, I will try to simulate the logic for an automotive performance package. Vehicles today have dozens of computers that together 
adjust the car's behavior in response to data read by hundreds of sensors. In this simplified system, let's assume that they are responding to 
two sensors —speed and lateral acceleration—to decide between a "high performance" and "economy" mode.

To generate simulated data we will use a Signal editor. We will simulate 2 signals: speed velocity, and acceleration in terms of direction, the 
velocity will always be positive as the car doesn't need performance modes in reverse. As for accelerations, we need the absolute value as 
decelerating will induce a different mode, therefore positive values are needed for condition purposes.

For the conditions: 
When traveling if (>100km/h) OR (>35km/h AND accelerating >3m/s^2)
  enable mode 1 
else 
  enable mode 2 

For the condition statements: I will use "Compare to Constant blocks" So if the velocity signal is >100 or >35. As for the Logic conditions, I will 
use "Logic Operators". Thus, if the velocity and accel is (>100) OR (>35 AND >3). Then using a switch statement will allow us to use the signal to 
activate performance modes. 

We will simulate performance modes using "Constant Blocks" with constants 1 and 2. Setting the switch statement to >1 will let the signal flow to 
constant 2 if the signal carries the true condition and activate mode 2. Else if not >1 the switch will activate the "else" signal and output mode 1.
(refer to Figure 1)

If we attach a scope to the system we view the results. As the car is in mode 1 for about 1.3 seconds and activates mode 2 after for about 0.7 seconds.
it seems the trigger condition what the speech>35lm/h and acceleration >3m/s^2. The second activation seems strange. like we see the that car is moving 
less than 100km/h and accelerating less than 3m/s^2. So how did it activate? Absolute value! Although was slowing down, it was decreasing at a rate smaller 
than -3m/s^2 thus taking ABS we get out trigger condition. The final activation point was the car traveling at 100km/h and we see it lasts longer on mode 2 
that the other sections. This is because we see the car traveling faster than 100km/h and decelerates at a slower rate, therefore allowing mode 2 to stay 
active for longer
